The increasing prevalence of age-related eye conditions such as presbyopia and cataracts, along with the rising demand for advanced surgical solutions, are key drivers of this market growth. As the global geriatric population continues to expand, the need for effective vision correction options has risen, contributing significantly to the market's expansion. Additionally, advancements in lens technology and improved patient outcomes are further fueling market demand. The market is also benefiting from the increasing awareness and acceptance of trifocal lenses as an alternative to traditional monofocal IOLs.
